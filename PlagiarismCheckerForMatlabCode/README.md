# Matlab Similarity Checker

## mfilecompare.m

To check code, run this file and select the folder with all of the code you wish to compare.

I did not write this code. See code comments for details.



## DivideFileTypes.m

It may be useful to divide the code out into separate files. For instance, if all of your students name one of their functions *f.m*, you probably only want to compare the *f.m* files and not all of the code. This script will do just that.
